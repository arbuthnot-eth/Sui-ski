# 2026-02-08

## Project Status

- **Branch**: `master` (clean)
- **Build**: Passing
- **Tests**: 30/30 passing
- **Lint**: Clean
- **Production**: Deployed and live at sui.ski

## Today

### Vault Created
- Initialized Obsidian vault for project tracking
- Documented full architecture, features, contracts, and infrastructure
- Catalogued all 70 TypeScript files and 18 Move contracts
- Mapped 20 most recent git commits

### Current State
The project is in a stable, production state. Recent work focused on:
- Marketplace improvements (caching, NFT tags, sold state)
- Mobile wallet stability (Phantom race conditions)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

No active development branches. Clean working tree.

### X402 Deep Research
Conducted full analysis of Coinbase's [x402 open-source protocol](https://github.com/coinbase/x402):
- Read all core TypeScript source (`@x402/core`, `@x402/hono`, `@x402/fetch`)
- Analyzed protocol types, hook system, scheme/network plugin architecture
- Compared Coinbase v2 implementation vs our `x402-middleware.ts` / `x402-sui.ts`
- Documented complete gap analysis with P0/P1/P2 priorities
- Discovered opportunity: **no `@x402/sui` package exists** - we could contribute it

Created 5 interlinked vault notes:
- [[X402 Payments]] (updated) - Hub note with gap table
- [[X402 Architecture]] - Protocol internals (types, hooks, 3-layer design)
- [[X402 Sui-ski Implementation]] - Full code walkthrough
- [[X402 Gap Analysis]] - Actionable upgrade priorities
- [[X402 Coinbase Ecosystem]] - SDKs, Hono API, Bazaar, grant opportunities

**Top 3 upgrade priorities identified:**
1. Hook system (enables free tier, analytics, error recovery)
2. Dynamic pricing (per-request pricing callbacks)
3. Zod schema validation (runtime type safety for payment payloads)

## Notes

### Key Learnings Documented
- [[Token Decimals]] - Critical decimal handling (NS=6, SUI=9)
- [[Error Codes]] - DeepBook V3 error 12 root cause
- [[Deployment]] - Use `npx wrangler deploy`, not `bun run deploy`

### Architecture Highlights
- 18 handlers generating inline HTML (no build step)
- Surflux gRPC primary resolution with SDK fallback
- Cross-subdomain SSO via Durable Objects
- 10+ wallet providers supported
